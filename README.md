## Introduction

Automation plays a crucial role in streamlining workflows and reducing manual effort. This repository serves as a hub for various automation projects implemented in Python and VBA, targeting different domains and tasks.

Whether you're looking to automate data processing, document generation, or repetitive tasks in Microsoft Excel, this repository provides insights and solutions to enhance productivity.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects available in this repository:

1. **SAP Exportation using VBA or Python**
  - VBA Script to initialize, filter and extract data from any SAP Transaction
  - Python code just to run the macro as a plus (not necessary)

2. **Google Drive FIle Organizer with Google OAuth**
  - Python script to login Google Drive using Google OAuth (google authentication) and upload or download files and folders
  - Get the token and credentials in Google Cloud Services

3. **Manipulate Pdf files**
  - Rotate, Merge, Extract Texts and Images, Reduce the file size, Encrypt and Decrypt

4. **QR Code Reading and Intrepretation**
- If you have a QR Code Scanner (same as in any store) and you need to do something with the code scanned, you might need this script. In *dist* folder you will find a *.exe* file that opens ready to receive the scanner information and, in my case, translates pieces of it and split them into a data frame column. 
- When the day is over, the employee clicks on 'Enviar leituras' and a *.csv* file is created in the same folder as your *.exe* file is with all information compiled. As an extra for my client, I did a button called 'Encerrar dia' that ends the script correctly and shut the computer down after 30 seconds.
- Scanner informations:
    - I am using a 1472g CCB Honeywell Scanner - one of their simplest
    - I set the scanner as Keyboard and asked the code to 'press' <Return> after reading the QR code.
    - To do the same, opens the instructions for your scanner and find ***Keyboard Behaviour***.
